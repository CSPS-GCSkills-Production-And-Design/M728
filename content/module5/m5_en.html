                            <h2>Guiding Principle 4 - Renewable and Clean Energy â€” Video Transcript</h2>
							<p>The next Guiding Principle pertains to renewable and clean energy. </p>
							<p>The best practice states that facilities should evaluate two options for obtaining access to renewable and clean energy. The first option is to implement an on-site renewable energy project when it is shown to be life-cycle cost effective. If this option is not feasible or cost-effective, the next option is to engage in the long-term procurement of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs).</p>
							<p>The recommended approach begins with a feasibility assessment for an on-site renewable energy project that can meet the requirements of all buildings. If this is not possible, the next step is to evaluate the feasibility of a building-specific installation where the electrical needs of a single building could be met using on-site renewable energy.</p>
							<p>When on-site renewable energy projects are not cost-effective, buildings may resort to the purchase of Renewable Energy Credits to fulfill this Guiding Principle.</p>
							<p>Clean Energy refers to both renewable electric energy and alternative energy.</p>
							<p>Renewable Electric Energy includes energy produced by solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean (including tidal, wave current and thermal), geothermal, micro turbines, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project. </p>
							<p>Alternative Energy includes energy generated from technologies and approaches that advance renewable heat sources, including solar thermal, biomass, geothermal, waste heat, combined heat and power; small modular nuclear reactor technologies; and fuel cell energy systems; where active capture and storage of carbon dioxide emissions associated with that energy generation is verified.</p>
							<p>One example of a Federal government building that is raising the bar regarding renewable and clean energy is the CanmetENERGY laboratory located in Varennes, Quebec.</p>
							<p>This facility conducts applied research aiming to facilitate the integration of distributed renewable energy sources to the electricity grid and to net-zero energy buildings in partnership with industry and utilities. The building itself is equipped with three renewable energy systems. The first is a solar wall that captures thermal energy from the sun and uses it to preheat the fresh air intake. At its peak performance, the system was shown to generate an estimated 10,000 kWh of thermal energy.  The second uses a solar photovoltaic system with an estimated generation capacity of 41,500 kWh per year. This system of 162 PV modules is split into 7 individual circuits to allow for testing of different inverter technologies. The third system includes an innovative solar-thermal heating and cooling system which uses a parabolic solar collector with an ejector-compressor to generate heating or cooling loads for use inside the building. This technology is currently being tested and optimized.</p>
							<p>As outlined in the Greening Government Strategy, Canada has committed to using 100% clean energy by 2025 by producing or purchasing megawatt hours of renewable electricity equivalent to that produced by the high-carbon portion of the electricity grid.</p>
							<p>Departments can demonstrate proper implementation using various documentation which can take the form of utility records, agreements, contracts, or photos of existing renewable energy generation projects; documentation showing that renewable energy credits have been acquired can also be used.</p>
							<p>NRCan offers tools to help evaluate the potential for renewable and alternative energy. These analysis products provide energy managers with information needed to perform their own pre-screening.</p>
							<p>RETScreen is a Clean Energy Management Software for energy efficiency, renewable energy and cogeneration project feasibility analysis as well as ongoing energy performance analysis.</p>
							<p>PV Perform Mod is a software tool that predicts the electricity output of a photovoltaic system, detects faults and evaluates system performance.</p>
							<p>NRCan has developed a database of photovoltaic potential and insolation. This database provides estimates of the electricity that can be generated by photovoltaic arrays for over 3500 municipalities in Canada.</p>
							<p>NRCan also has a web page dedicated to highlighting renewable and clean energy projects in Canada. Visit the website shown to explore Canadian success stories.</p>
