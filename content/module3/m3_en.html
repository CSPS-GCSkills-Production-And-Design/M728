                            <p>This is the second Guiding Principle for optimizing energy performance in existing buildings. The process of establishing a baseline of energy performance is the starting point for benchmarking. Once a building produces information about how energy is consumed on-site, the facility team can use this information to prioritize improvement projects.</p>
                            <p>The Energy Efficiency of a building can be calculated using a metric called "Energy Use Intensity" which is expressed in kWh/m&sup2;. This concept is used to measure how efficiently energy is being used within a building and allows for comparison to other buildings of similar size and operation. Benchmarking typically aims to improve the Energy Use Intensity of a building.</p>
                            <p>There are two common software tools that can be used to facilitate the benchmarking process in the federal sector. ENERGY STAR PORTFOLIO MANAGER and RETScreen Expert are the leading tool for tracking and comparing building energy use over time.</p>
                            <p>Benchmarking Best Practices state that facility managers should set energy performance benchmarks annually, preferably using PORTFOLIO MANAGER or RETScreen to compare their actual performance against the established benchmark. This involves regularly monitoring building energy performance against historical performance and peer buildings.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring accountability for the government’s environmental performance and will adhere to this commitment using the principles of transparency and open data.</p>
                            <p>Facilities can demonstrate proper implementation using documentation from ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager or RETScreen. Property types that are not eligible for an ENERGY STAR Score can still generate reports showing benchmarking properties and trends of energy use over time. Facilities that choose not to use Portfolio Manager can set benchmarks and compare their energy performance using other means such as utility billing data or internal energy reports.</p>
                            <p>ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager is a free, interactive energy management tool that allows users to track, assess, and benchmark energy and water consumption for all facility types across entire building portfolios.</p>
                            <p>Portfolio Manager has a standardized metric for comparing whole building energy performance to similar buildings of specific “ratable” types.</p>
                            <p>Another tool that can be used for benchmarking purposes is RETScreen Expert. Developed by the Government of Canada, RETScreen Expert is a software for energy efficiency and renewable energy project feasibility analysis as well as ongoing energy analysis.</p>
                            <p>This tool has many functions and can be used to: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>perform portfolio-wide analyses</li>
								<li>collect information on a facility</li>
								<li>perform benchmarking analyses</li>
								<li>track energy and GHG emissions </li>
								<li>for general performance analyses</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>This tool is used widely throughout government and industry, some of the key users include: </p>

								<li>Oxford Properties</li>
								<li>Canadian Tire</li>
