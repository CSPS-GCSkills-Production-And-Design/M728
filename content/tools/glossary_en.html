                        <p>The Auditor General of Canada is an Officer of Parliament who carries out work on behalf of Parliament and who is accountable to Parliament.</p>
                        <p>The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) serves Parliament by providing it with objective, fact-based information and expert advice on government programs and activities, gathered through audits. Parliamentarians use OAG reports to oversee government activities and hold the federal government to account for its handling of public funds.</p>
                        <p>The OAG audits a vast range of activities conducted by the Canadian federal government and the three territories (Nunavut, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories). These activities cover topics such as procurement, health, culture, the environment, finance, agriculture, transportation, and scientific research, to name only a few.</p>
                        <p>Regarding <strong>procurement activities</strong>, the objectives of an audit are to ensure that an adequate management-control framework is in place to effectively support contracting and procurement activities, and that contracting and procurement activities are processed in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, directives, and procedures. Such a framework will help management to receive reliable and relevant information on contracting to support informed decision-making, risk management, and effective disclosure. Also, having governance structures in place makes it possible to review and act upon contracting trends and risks.</p>

                        <p>The Information Commissioner plays a critical role in ensuring that government records remain open to public scrutiny, in keeping with the requirements of the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-12"><em>Access to Information Act</em></a> . The Act gives Canadian citizens, including the media, people, and corporations present in Canada, the right to access the information held in federal government records. It ensures that individuals and organizations can ask for information and, if it is not exempt or excluded, requires that the federal government allow the requestor to see or receive a copy of the information.</p>
                        <p>Exemptions protect certain types of information (e.g.&nbsp;information related to national security).</p>
                        <p>Exclusions involve Cabinet documents and information that is already available publicly (e.g.&nbsp;publications or material in libraries and museums).</p>
                        <p><strong>Procurement specialists</strong> should be cognizant of the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-12"><em>Access to Information Act</em></a> and understand the rights that the Act affords Canadians, particularly the supplier community and the media, as well as the legal obligations it entails for them as public officials. For example, they must be judicious in documenting decisions and maintaining government records.</p>

                        <p>The Privacy Commissioner is responsible for administering the provisions of the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-13"><em>Privacy Act</em></a>, which is designed to protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by the government. The Act also provides individuals with a right of access to that information.</p>
                        <p>The Privacy Commissioner works independently from any other part of the government, acting as an advocate for the privacy rights of Canadians. The Privacy Commissioner has the power to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Investigate complaints and conduct audits;</li>
                            <li>Publish information about personal information-handling practices in the public and private sectors;</li>
                            <li>Conduct research into privacy issues; and</li>
                            <li>Promote awareness and understanding of privacy issues among the Canadian public.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Contracts</strong> involving the handling of personal information of Canadians are a prime example of the types of issues of concern to the Privacy Commissioner. In planning projects where outsourcing is a consideration, it is important to identify, assess and mitigate possible risks associated with the handling of personal information. This may involve, for example, a decision not to outsource, or to include specific provisions in the contract aimed at protecting personal information.</p>

                        <p>The Commissioner of Lobbying is an independent Officer of Parliament, appointed by both houses of Parliament for a term of seven years. The Commissioner of Lobbying&rsquo;s mandate, derived from the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-14"><em>Lobbying Act</em></a> , is to ensure transparency and accountability in the lobbying of federal public office holders in order to increase Canadians' confidence in the integrity of government decision-making.</p>
                        <p>The Commissioner&rsquo;s mandate is threefold, as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintain the Registry of Lobbyists, which contains and makes public the registration information disclosed by lobbyists; </li>
                            <li>Develop and implement educational programs to foster public awareness of the requirements of the Act; and </li>
                            <li>Conduct reviews and investigations to ensure compliance with the Act and the <em>Lobbyists' Code of Conduct</em>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>About contracting… </strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The use of lobbyists by a prospective contractor is not prohibited. However, contractors who do business with the government must not retain lobbyists whom they pay on a contingency basis. This means that lobbyists must not be paid a fee or compensation related to the value of the contract. If lobbyists are retained in connection with a proposed or actual contract with the Crown, they should be paid on a fee-for-services or retainer basis.</li>
                            <li>The restriction on the use of lobbyists applies only to contracts where lobbyists are or may be expected to be used. Each contracting authority should determine whether or not they will use lobbyists in advance and if they are (or could possibly be) used, a clause prohibiting payment on a contingency fee basis must be included in the contract between the Crown and the supplier.</li>
                            <li>In circumstances where organizations contract with lobbyists to assist them in seeking grants or contributions from federal government entities, fees paid to lobbyists should not be related to the value of any grant or contribution. Departments and agencies are to ensure that organizations seeking various forms of government assistance should not pay lobbyists on a contingency fee basis.</li>
                            <li>All contracting authorities must include in all applicable contracts a lobbyist certification clause to prohibit suppliers from engaging lobbyists on a contingency fee basis to help them obtain contracts. Contracting authorities should seek the advice of their legal representatives on the specific wording of an appropriate clause. </li>

                        <p>The Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner investigates wrongdoing in the federal public sector and helps protect from reprisal whistleblowers and those who participate in investigations.</p>
                        <p>The Office is an independent federal organization created in 2007 under the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-15"><em>Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act</em></a>. The Office is led by a Commissioner who reports directly to Parliament and has jurisdiction over most federal public sector organizations, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Crown corporations.</p>
                        <p>The Office&rsquo;s mission is to provide a confidential and independent response to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Disclosures of wrongdoing in the federal public sector from public servants or members of the public; and</li>
                            <li>Complaints of reprisal from public servants and former public servants. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, the Office: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Makes recommendations to chief executives for corrective measures; and </li>
                            <li>Identifies serious breaches of the <em>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</em> in the Annual Report to Parliament. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Procurement specialists </strong>must understand that the government proactively discloses information on contracts over $10,000. The proactive disclosure of contracts reflects broader government commitments to transparency and strengthened accountability within the public sector.</p>

                        <p>The Commissioner of Official Languages is mandated under the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-16"><em>Official Languages Act</em></a> to ensure recognition of the status of each of the official languages of Canada, including monitoring the activities of federal departments and agencies to ensure compliance with the spirit and intent of the Act. In that role, the Commissioner conducts audits to determine how federal institutions are responding to their obligations under the Act, and regularly reports to Parliament on how well they are meeting their language obligations. In addition, the Commissioner has the authority to conduct investigations on complaints from the public and takes action further to these complaints, if applicable.</p>
                        <p>The Act has specific implications for the <strong>procurement function</strong>. For example, any contract for the provision of services where the government department itself would be required to provide services in either official language must include a requirement for the contractor to provide the services in either official language. In addition, suppliers must be dealt with in the official language of their choice, and should have access to information related to the procurement process in the official language of their choice.</p>
                        <p>When bid solicitations are national in scope or originate from an office having the obligation to serve the public in both official languages (refer to the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-17">List of Bilingual Regions of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes</a> ), <strong>all regular or standardized documents</strong> must be provided in both official languages (whether through the media or by electronic communications systems).  This requirement also applies to public notices such as Notices of Proposed Procurement, terms and conditions, basic forms, bid solicitations, standards,  purchase descriptions, and contracts.</p>
                        <p>Where <strong>non&#8209;standardized documents</strong>, such as specifications, are used, the federal institution initiating the requirement is responsible for determining if these documents must be available in both official languages. Such documents may be provided in only one official language when the institution determines and can substantiate, based on relevant information regarding their public and the marketplace, that they will be requested in that language only. </p>
                        <p>When the bidding is not national in scope or when an office of a federal institution does not have obligations under the Act and Regulations, the contracting documents may be prepared only in the official language of the majority of the population concerned. This also applies to subsequent operations.</p>

                        <p>With regards to contracting, public office holders and former public office holders must adhere to specific conflict-of-interest rules. They must not act in a manner that furthers their private interests or those of relatives or friends.</p>
