                            <p>After setting an energy performance benchmark, the next step is to develop and evaluate options for improving the energy efficiency of a building.</p>
                            <p>There are three Best Practices to follow when looking to improve energy efficiency as shown on the slide. Implement these best practices as applicable depending on the age of the building, the state of the current operating conditions and the availability of information about energy-using systems.</p>
                            <p>When there is little information available on current operating conditions, the first best practice is to conduct a building-wide energy audit to identify the major energy-users and uncover opportunities for improvement. If the building’s energy performance and operating conditions are known, it might be appropriate to implement best practice number two, which relates to recommissioning. In fact, best practice recommends performing recommissioning every 5 years to ensure and maintain optimal building performance. The final best practice is to ensure that energy efficient products and equipment are being procured and installed as required.</p>
                            <p>When we speak of Energy Efficiency, there are two Key Performance Indicators that facilities can use to gauge success.</p>
                            <p>The first option is to obtain an ENERGY STAR score of 75 or higher using Portfolio Manager. The ENERGY STAR score is calculated using building characteristics and consumption information to provide an external reference that helps energy managers assess how efficiently a building uses energy relative to similar buildings. A score of 75 or higher indicates that your building is in the top 25 percentile of performance in comparison to buildings of the same operation type.</p>
                            <p>Reports from Portfolio Manager can be used to demonstrate proper implementation in this area. In addition, certain eligible commercial and institutional buildings that achieve a score of 75 or higher can apply for an ENERGY STAR label through NRCan's ENERGY STAR building certification program.</p>
                            <p>We will go into more detail about ENERGY STAR ratings in the following slides.</p>
                            <p>ENERGY STAR scores range between 1 and 100.</p>
                            <p>Buildings that receive a low score may be great candidates for major energy efficiency upgrades. This may include buildings that have been targeted for energy improvements and can show significant savings following the installation of new equipment. </p>
                            <p>Scores between 25 and 50 may need a combination of building improvements and minor adjustments. </p>
                            <p>Buildings scoring between 50 and 75 can benefit from lighting and building control upgrades or recommissioning. Recommissioning is a periodic, recurring re-optimization process that is carried out after 3 to 5 years.</p>
                            <p>Buildings over 75 are performing in the top percentile. Further improvements can be achieved through tenant education, ongoing commissioning and initiation of a plug load reduction strategy. Ongoing commissioning is a continuous process that often involves data analytics using fault detection software.</p>
                            <p>While all facilities can track and assess energy, Greenhouse gas emissions, and water use by using ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, currently there are only seven building types eligible to receive an Energy Star Score: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Ice rinks</li>
								<li>K-12 schools</li>
								<li>Medical offices</li>
								<li>Hospitals</li>
								<li>Supermarkets</li>
								<li>Office buildings</li>
								<li>Senior care communities</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>NRCan is developing new scores on a progressive basis, and your building type could be next!</p>
                            <p>If a building is not eligible for an ENERGY STAR Score, it can still demonstrate superior energy efficiency by achieving the second Key Performance indicator which is a 30% energy efficiency improvement over the current ASHRAE 90.1 standard. This option requires an energy simulation to determine the actual energy efficiency of the building. ASHRAE 90.1 is an American National Standard that provides minimum requirements for energy efficient designs for buildings except for low-rise residential buildings.</p>
                            <p>For existing buildings, energy managers can use various software such as CAN-Quest to determine how it compares to the latest 90.1 Standard.</p>
                            <p>For new buildings, facility managers should review the design and commissioning records on file. Has an energy analysis been completed, and if so, what were the results? </p>
                            <p>For buildings completing major renovations, facility managers should inquire with their energy service provider to determine if savings have already been calculated. </p>
                            <p>A building can demonstrate success in this area using reports from the energy simulation or another form of energy use model that confirms a 30% better efficiency than ASHRAE 90.1.</p>
                            <p>A good example of implementing this principle is through improving efficiency in plug loads. Energy consumed by plug loads is one of the largest and fastest growing end-uses in the commercial building sector. Examining opportunities to reduce plug loads may reveal low-cost options for reducing energy consumption.</p>
                            <p>Break rooms, office electronics and data centres are prime candidates to consider when looking to reduce plug loads. Reducing these loads will help these facilities meet their energy efficiency targets.</p>
